1) Commit

    Changes made in our files are not tracked by Git until we commit them. Thus, Commit is essentially a change to one or more
    files in terms of Git. Each commit made is assigned a unique id.

2) Branch

    Branches provide the mechanism for multiple people to work on the same code in isolation. When we create a branch, the state
    of source branch is copied to the new branch.

    Note: The new branch is independent and changes made in it do not affect the source branch. Once we are done with all the 
    changes in the new branch, we can make a pull request to merge the new branch back with source branch.
