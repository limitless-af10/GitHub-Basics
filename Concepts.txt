1) Commit

    Changes made in our files are not tracked by Git until we commit them. Thus, Commit is essentially a change to one or more
    files in terms of Git. Each commit made is assigned a unique id.

2) Branch

    Branches provide the mechanism for multiple people to work on the same code in isolation. When we create a branch, the state
    of source branch is copied to the new branch.
